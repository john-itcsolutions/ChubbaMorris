Uses Elastos ELA blockchain+ system.
ELA tokens (fractional) partly as price of transactions,
predominantly as general digital currency.
"Merge mined" by Bitcoin miners.
Truly distributed ledger. No servers involved.
Secure Runtime for the client,
and secure Carrier network for the internet.
Trust is embedded by distributing ledgers ..  Each participant in a transaction has a key to their copy of the record.  The mechanism of the Blockchain ensures faithful and verifiable copies of every transaction.  The Bitcoin mining process 'underwrites' the Elastos blockchain's trust mechanism.

'This will be better than sliced bread':
