# ChubbaMorris

Real Estate & Agencies, Property Management, Community Housing, Conveyancing, Solicitors & Land Title Registries

Uses Elastos ELA "blockchain+" system.
ELA tokens (fractional) partly as price of transactions,
predominantly as general digital currency.
"Merge mined" by Bitcoin miners.
Truly distributed ledger. No servers involved.
Secure Elastos.RT Runtime for the client,
and secure Elastos Carrier network for the internet.
Employs the open and adaptable standard Component Assembly Runtime (CAR) framework.
The CAR framework enables linking of components between devices, flexibly across systems.
Trust is embedded by distributing ledgers ..  Each participant in a transaction has a key to their copy of the record.  
The mechanism of the Blockchain ensures faithful and verifiable copies of every transaction.  
The Bitcoin Blockchain mining process 'underwrites' the Elastos Blockchain's trust mechanism.  
Your transactions are 'mined' in order to validate and seal them.

'This will be better than sliced bread':
